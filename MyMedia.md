### Code fencing

Merge two python dictionaries into one, or as many dictionaries as you have. The below code is collected based on my S number. My last second number is 3 so it is collected from python and last number is 4 so 4+1 it is 5. so we need to take 5th code but 5th is only one line so took 6th code.

```
def merge_dicts(*dicts):
  super_dict = {}
  for dict in dicts:
      for k, v in dict.items():
          super_dict[k] = v

 return super_dict
